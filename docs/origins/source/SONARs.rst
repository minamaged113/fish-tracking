SONAR
=====

A SONAR is short for (So)und (Na)vigation (R)anging, a technique which uses sound to locate objects in dark media with bad lighting conditions.
There are two main types of SONARs, namely, Active and Passive. Passive SONARs are continuous listeners for any sound waves received. Active SONARs on the other hand, emit pulses of acoustic waves, called "pings", using a transmitter, and listens for reflections, using a receiver.
These pulses are usually generated a signal generator, power amplifier and electro-acoustic transducer.
.. ## TODO : Look for a diagram for this, or create one.

A beamformer is used to concentrate the acoustic power into a beam. However, a single-beam systems have very small coverage, while multibeam systems have wider coverage.

.. ## TODO : Diagram for single and multi beamed systems
