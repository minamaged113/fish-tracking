SONAR
=====

A SONAR is short for (So)und (Na)vigation (R)anging, a technique which uses sound to locate objects in dark media with bad lighting conditions.
There are two main types of SONARs, namely, Active and Passive. Passive SONARs are continuous listeners for any sound waves received. Active SONARs on the other hand, emit pulses of acoustic waves, called "pings", using a transmitter, and listens for reflections, using a receiver.
These pulses are usually generated a signal generator, power amplifier and electro-acoustic transducer.
.. ## TODO : Look for a diagram for this, or create one.

A beamformer is used to concentrate the acoustic power into a beam. However, a single-beam systems have very small coverage, while multibeam systems have wider coverage.

.. ## TODO : Diagram for single and multi beamed systems

There are two types of SONARs according to the frequency that they emit. the first are Single Frequency SONARs, second, Changing Frequency SONARs. Usually, Single Frequency SONARs, are used for simplest cases, but usually Changing Frequency SONARs are used for multitude of purposes.

The distance between the an object and the SONAR can be measured by knowing the speed of sound in the medium at hand, calculating the transmission time difference between emitting a pulse and receiving it, then calculating the distance becomes a simple velocity equation:
